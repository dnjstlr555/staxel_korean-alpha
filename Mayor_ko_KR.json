Excellent!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015560":"Let the festivities begin!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015570":"I'd suggest you try to participate as much as possible!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015580":"The more people taking part, the more who will be intrigued and be enticed to participate!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015590":"Head over to the ^c:1486b0;small festival grounds^c:pop; whenever you're ready!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015600":"How are you enjoying the harvest festival, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015610":"I must say that it turned out much better than expected!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015620":"Still not quite the tourist attraction I had hoped...but there's still time!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015630":"Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015640":"Did...did you win the grand prize? At a festival you helped set up?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015650":"That's... That's...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015660":"Well I suppose that's legal... We never forbade it in any way...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015670":"In any case, here is the grand prize, as promised to the bearer of the ^c:1486b0;voucher^c:pop;.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015680":"Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I do believe we pulled off quite the event!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015690":"Good to see you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, though I have some unfortunate news.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015700":"Despite our best efforts, it seems the festival was not quite as successful as I'd hoped...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015710":"It was moderately successful, but not fantastic. Not nearly enough to fund my new office.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015720":"We need to attract investors with significant funds—individuals who see the island's potential!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015730":"While historic tourism was the cause of my last attempt at retirement, I fear we must try it once more...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10015740":"Perhaps you could put your artistic talents to good use and produce a pair of ^c:1486b0;historic statues^c:pop;?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10021600":"Figures who made the island what it is today!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10021700":"Once completed, place them within the town and use the ^c:1486b0;plaques^c:pop; to designate them!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10021800":"I do hope those ^c:1486b0;statues^c:pop; will draw in more tourism than our previous attempt...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10021900":"Excellent! Rather awe-inspiring, I must say!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022000":"I have it on good authority that our first tourists have arrived too!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022100":"Perhaps you could speak with them and gather their feedback?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022200":"It could be invaluable to ensuring their investment!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022300":"So what did the tourists have to say about our town?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022400":"Were they impressed? Have we secured investors?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022500":"They...weren't happy then? The statues were no good?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022600":"I'm sorry, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. It seems I might have wasted your time.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022700":"But...do you think you might be up to trying again?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022800":"Maybe if we had exactly the right statues and a little bit of luck...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10022900":"Maybe then someone would show a bit more interest in the town!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023000":"Make sure you remove the previous two ^c:1486b0;statues^c:pop;...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023100":"These new ones might attract a more helpful crowd...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023200":"Don't forget to remove the two ^c:1486b0;statues^c:pop; you erected before.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023300":"They didn't seem to go down too well with the visitors...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023400":"Nice job, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023500":"Now all we can do is hope.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023600":"I'd suggest going to see how our latest tourist is finding the town.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023700":"Perhaps this is one we might be able to convince...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023800":"I believe the new tourist is over by one of the ^c:1486b0;statues^c:pop; you placed.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10023900":"Do your best to convince him so we can keep the town flourishing!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024000":"^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Wonderful news!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024100":"We found an investor!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024200":"A strange man in a suit? Resorts? Glass offices?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024300":"What on earth are you rambling on about?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024400":"Apparently, a local historian was passing through when you erected those ^c:1486b0;historic monuments^c:pop;!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024500":"He immediately recognised their likenesses and realised that the island was central in some ancient war or other!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024600":"So now we're getting a grant as a world heritage site! Can you believe that?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024700":"Fantastic work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I couldn't have done it without you!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024800":"You practically saved the entire town! Or, its financing at least!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10024900":"This is never going to be enough to repay what you've given us...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025000":"But maybe you'd appreciate the honour of being the one to place our ^c:1486b0;commemorative plaque^c:pop;?","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025100":"Or not, of course! I leave that decision entirely up to you!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025200":"Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.

Am I glad to see you.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025700":"Last night was truly terrible!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025800":"I have no idea where I am or how I got here.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10025900":"I was just in the middle of doing some... something important!","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10026000":"And then poof! I find myself in this primitive living space.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10026100":"But never mind that... something much worse happened after that...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10026200":"I misplaced my hat! I can't find it anywhere.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10026300":"Someone must have stolen it!

He did take my hat though...","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10028800":"But he didn't really seem malicious.","staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10028900":"I need to go back to the village for now.
